<h2>Translators needed!</h2>

<p>
We'd like to make the basic content of the NTP Pool website available
in just about any language; but we need your help!
</p>

<h3>What you'll need</h3>

<p class="block">
<ul class="block bullet">
      <li>Fluent reader of English and fluent in some other language.</li>
      <li>A couple of hours to do the initial translation.</li>
      <li>20-30 minutes about once or twice every 3 months to update the translation with changes.</li>
      <li>Some knowledge of basic HTML.</li>
      <li>Ideally basic familiarity with git or subversion.</li>
      <li>Crazy desire to work for free for no thanks but the benefit of thousands!</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h3>Get started</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to get started is
to <a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool/zipball/master">download a
zip file</a> or 'clone' the code
with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.  To <a href="http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/">use git</a>,
start by creating an account on github</a> and then
<a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">clone (aka fork)</a>
<a href="http://github.com/abh/ntppool/">the repository</a>.
</p>

<p>If you use git, it's slightly easier for me, but don't get stuck on
that - the zipfile method works too.</p>

<p>
Please subscribe to the (very low
traffic) <a href="https://lists.ntp.org/listinfo/pool-i18n">timekeepers-i18n
mailinglist</a>.
</p>


<h3>Do the translation</h3>
<p>
When you have the source code, you will find the strings to translate in two places:

<ul class="bullet">
<li>.po files in the i18n/ directory.  They can be edited with any
text editor or a dedicated tool, for
example <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">po edit</a>.  If there's no
file for your language you can start one by copying the en.po
file.</li>

<li>Language specific HTML files in the docs/ntppool/ directory.
Start by copying the 'en/' directory.  Only the files in the "language
directory" needs translation.  The rest are either only provided in
English or translated via the .po files.  The most important files are
"homepage.html", "join.html" and "use.html".

</li>

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Submit it back</h3>
<p>
When you are done, either commit with git and push to github to make
a <a href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">pull request</a> or
zip up your work and tell me the name of the .zip file you started
from or push with git to github
and <a href="mailto:ask@develooper.com">send me a note about it</a>.
</p>

<h3>Beta test</h3>
<p>
To start the new language will show up on
the <a href="http://www.beta.grundclock.com/">beta site</a>.  When it
is up there, please review it and if possible get someone else fluent
in your language to look through it. When you tell me it's good to go
to the main site I will enable it there as well.
